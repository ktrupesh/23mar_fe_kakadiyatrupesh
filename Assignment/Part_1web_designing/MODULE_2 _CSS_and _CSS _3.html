(Q.3) What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?

 Ans =>  Major Differences Between CSS, CSS2 & CSS3
        
        Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules,
        which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle. With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts,
        like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.

(Q.4) Name a few CSS style components.

 Ans => Color - Sets the color of the text or background. For example:
         
        body{
         color: red;
         background-color: #FFF;
        }

        Font - Defines the font family, size, weight, and style of the text. For example:

        h2{
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 16px;
            font-weight: bold;
            font-style: italic;
        }    
 
       Padding - Adds space between the content and the border of an element. For example:

        body{
            padding: 10px;
        }
    
        Margin - Adds space between the element and surrounding elements. For example:

        p{
            margin: 20px;
        }
        
(Q.5) What do you understand by CSS opacity?

 Ans => The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. 
        Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

        Ex: 
            div{
                opacity: 0.8; /* 1 means fully visible, 0 means invisible */
            }

(Q.6) How can the background color of an element be changed?

Ans =>  To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. 
        Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. 
        Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.

        Ex:
            body {
                background-color: coral;
                color : #fff;
            }

(Q.7)  How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

 Ans => To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property.

            Ex: 
            body {
                background-image: url("paper.gif");
                background-repeat: repeat-y;
            }
(Q.8) What is the use of the background-position property?

 Ans => The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. 
        Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element,
         and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

         Ex: 
         /* Keyword values */
         background-position: top;
         background-position: bottom;
         background-position: left;
         background-position: right;
         background-position: center;
         
         /* % length values where 0 is top left */
         background-position: 20% 70%;
         
         /* absolute length values */
         background-position: 0 0;
         background-position: 1rem 2em;
         background-position: 10vh 8rem;
         
         /* Multiple images */
         background-position: 0 0, center;
         
         /* Edge offsets values */
         background-position: bottom 10px right 20px;
         background-position: right 3em bottom 10px;
         background-position: bottom 10px right;
         background-position: top right 10px;

(Q.9)  Which property controls the image scroll in the background?

 Ans => background-attachment property
        The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page,
        or is fixed.

        Ex :
        <style>
            header{
                background-attachment: scroll;
            }
        </style>

(Q.10)  Why should background and color be used as separate properties?

 Ans =>  Using background and color as separate properties in CSS allows for greater control and flexibility when styling elements.
         Each property targets a specific aspect of an element's appearance, making it easier to apply and manage styles.

         1.Separation of concerns: 
                                    background and color are separate properties because they target different aspects of an element's appearance.
                                    background is responsible for setting the background color, image, position, size, and other properties of an element. 
                                    color sets the color of the text content within an element. By keeping these properties separate, you can independently manage 
                                    the background and text color of an element without affecting the other.

         2.Readability and maintainability:
                                             Separating these properties makes it easier to read and maintain your code.
                                             When you have clear, distinct properties for each aspect of an element's style, it's easier to understand what each line of CSS 
                                             is doing. This makes it simpler to troubleshoot and modify existing code.                                    

         3.Flexibility:
                         Using separate properties for background and color allows you to apply specific styles to different 
                         parts of your elements. For example, you may want to change the background color of a button when it's hovered over, 
                         but keep the text color the same. By keeping these properties separate, it's easy to modify one without affecting the other.                                             


        Ex :
            /* Using separate properties */

            .button {
                background: #ff9900;
                color: #ffffff;
            }
        
            .button:hover {
                background: #cc7a00;
            }
        
        
            /* Using a shorthand property */
        
            .button {
                background-color: #ff9900;
                color: #ffffff;
            }
        
            .button:hover {
                background-color: #cc7a00;
            }

            In both cases, the color property remains independent of the background or background-color property, 
            making it easier to control and manage the styles for each aspect of the button. 

(Q.11) How to center block elements using CSS1?

 Ans => CSS1 does not provide a direct way to center block elements horizontally or vertically. However, you can achieve horizontal
        centering by setting the left and right margins of the block element to "auto". For example:

        Ex : 
            <div style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #ccc;">
                This block element is horizontally centered.
            </div>

            For vertical centering, you can use the CSS1 technique of setting the top and bottom padding of the containing element to the same value, 
            and then setting the top and bottom margins of the block element to "auto". For example:            

            Ex :
                <div style="height: 200px; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px; background-color: #ccc;">
                    <div style="height: 100px; margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; background-color: #fff;">
                        This block element is vertically centered.
                    </div>
              </div>

            Note that these techniques work only when the width and height of the block elements are known. 
            If the size of the block elements is not fixed, you may need to use a different approach, such as using CSS2 or later techniques.  

(Q.12) How to maintain the CSS specifications?

Ans =>  1.Use a consistent naming convention: 
                                            Develop a naming convention for your CSS classes and stick to it.
                                            This will make it easier to understand and maintain the codebase over time.

        2.Comment your code:
                             Add comments to your CSS code to explain what each section does.
                             This will make it easier to understand the code and make changes later on.

        3.Use version control: 
                                Use a version control system such as Git to track changes to your CSS files. 
                                This will allow you to easily revert to previous versions if needed.

        4.Minimize the use of !important:
                                         Try to avoid using the !important declaration in your CSS code as it can make it difficult
                                         to override styles later on.

        5.Use a preprocessor: 
                            Consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to make it easier to maintain your code.
                            Preprocessors allow you to write cleaner and more organized code, and can save you time in the long run.

        6.Document your style guide:
                                     Develop a style guide for your project and document it in a central location.
                                     This will help ensure consistency across your codebase and make it easier to maintain the project over time.

        7.Regularly audit your code:
                                     Regularly review your CSS code to identify any outdated or unnecessary styles.
                                     This will help keep your codebase lean and easy to maintain.

(Q.13)  What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?

 Ans => CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways.

        1. (External CSS) :
                            Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

              Ex: 
                <head>
                    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css">
                </head>

        2. (Internal CSS) :
                            An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.The internal style is defined inside the <style></style> element, inside the head section.

                Ex:
                    <!DOCTYPE html>
                    <html>
                    <head>
                        <style>
                        body {
                            background-color: linen;
                        }
                
                        h1 {
                            color: maroon;
                            margin-left: 40px;
                        }
                    </style>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                
                        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                
                    </body>
                    </html>

        3. (Inline CSS) :
                         An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

                Ex:
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <body>

                    <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
                    <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
                </body>
                </html>

(Q.14) What is embedded style sheets?

 Ans => An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document.
        It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) 
        gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.

        Ex: 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Name.css">
        </head>
        <body>
        .
        .
        .
        </body>
        </html>


(Q.15)  What are the external style sheets?

 Ans => An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. 
        The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

        Ex: 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Name.css">
        </head>
        <body>
        .
        .
        .
        </body>
        </html>


(Q.16)  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?

 Ans => ___________________________________________________________________________

        |___________________________________|_____________________________________|


(Q.17)  What is the meaning of the CSS selector?  

 Ans => A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the 
        browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.

        Ex :
            ('class') : css selector :

                .p {
                    text-align: center;
                    color: red;
                }
        

            ('id') : css selector :

                #p {
                    text-align: center;
                    color: red;
                }

(Q.18)  What are the media types allowed by CSS?

 Ans =>     CSS2 Introduced Media Types :
                                        The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

                                        Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.
                                                  Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

            Ex:
                /* Max-width */
                @media only screen and (max-width: 600px)  {...}
            
                /* Min-width */
                @media only screen and (min-width: 600px)  {...}
            
                /* Combining media query expressions */
                @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 400px)  {...}                                                  


(Q.19)  What is the rule set?

(Q.20)  Create Layouts.

 Ans => Float Layout - Uses the float property to float elements left or right, allowing content and inline elements to wrap around them.

    .left {
        float: left;
    }
  
    .right {
        float: right; 
    }

    Flexbox Layout - Uses the flexbox model to align items in a container in a efficient way. Can be either a row or column layout.
  
    .flex-container {
        display: flex;
    }
  
    .flex-row {
        flex-direction: row;
    }
  
    .flex-column {
        flex-direction: column; 
    }
    
    Grid Layout - Uses a grid system with rows and columns to align content. Items can span multiple rows and columns.
  
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        grid-gap: 1rem;
    }
  
    Positioning Layout - Uses the position property to absolutely or relatively position elements.
  
    .relative {
        position: relative;
        left: 20px;
        top: 20px; 
    }
  
    .absolute {
        position: absolute;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
    } 
  
    Table Layout - Uses HTML tables to create a layout. Not very flexible but useful for simple layouts.
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Column 1</td> 
            <td>Column 2</td>
        </tr>
  </table>
