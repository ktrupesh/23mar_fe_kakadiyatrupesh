                                   ======****     MODULE: 1 (HTML)     ****======
    
    (Q.1) :  Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

    Ans =>   HTML Tags are building blocks of HTML Pages. 
             HTML Elements are components that are used in HTML Pages.

    (Q.2) :  What are tags and attributes in HTML?

    Ans =>  All HTML elements can have attributes. 
            Attributes provide additional information about elements.
            Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
            Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like name="value".

    (Q.3) : What are void elements in HTML?

    Ans => A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances.
           Void elements can have attributes. The following is a complete list of the void elements in HTML: area, base,
           br , col, command , embed , hr , img , input , keygen , link , meta , param , source , track , wbr.

    (Q.4) : What are HTML Entities?

    Ans => An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).
           Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code),
           and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).

    (Q.5) : What are different types of lists in HTML? 

    Ans => In HTML, there are three main types of lists: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.

           Ordered Lists:
                            An ordered list is a numbered list, where each list item is preceded by a sequential number.
                            The HTML tag used to create an ordered list is <ol>. Each item in the list is enclosed in an <li> tag.

    Example code for an ordered list:
    
    <ol>
      <li>First item</li>
      <li>Second item</li>
      <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

    This will produce a numbered list like this:
    
     1.First item
    
     2.Second item
    
     3.Third item
    
    Unordered Lists:
    An unordered list is a bulleted list, where each item is preceded by a bullet point. The HTML tag used to create an unordered list is <ul>. Each item in the list is enclosed in an <li> tag.
    
    Example code for an unordered list:
    
    
    <ul>
       <li>First item</li>
       <li>Second item</li>
       <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>

    
    This will produce a bulleted list like this:
    
     . First item

     .Second item

     .Third item

    Definition Lists:
                     A definition list is a list of terms and their definitions.
                     The HTML tags used to create a definition list are <dl> for the entire list,
                      <dt> for the term, and <dd> for the definition.

    Example code for a definition list:
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Term 1</dt>
      <dd>Definition 1</dd>
      <dt>Term 2</dt>
      <dd>Definition 2</dd>
      <dt>Term 3</dt>
      <dd>Definition 3</dd>
    </dl>


    This will produce a list like this:
    
    Term 1
       Definition 1
    
    Term 2
       Definition 2
    
    Term 3
       Definition

    (Q.6) :  What is the 'class' attribute in HTML?

    Ans =>  The class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element.
            The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
            However, it can also be used by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes 
            to HTML elements with a specified class.

    (Q.7) : What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements?

    Ans => Remember the difference between Class and ID: 
           A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one 
           HTML element within the page.

    (Q.8) :  What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

    Ans => Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
           
        (1)<b> - Bold text</b>
        
           Ex: <b> - Bold text   </b>

        (2) <strong> - Important text</strong>
        (3 <i> - Italic text</i>
        (4)<em> - Emphasized text</em>
        (5)<mark> - Marked text</mark>
        (6)<small> - Smaller text</small>
        (7)<del> - Deleted text</del>
        (6)<ins> - Inserted text</ins>
        (8)<sub> - Subscript text</sub>
        (9)<sup> - Superscript text</sup>
       
    (Q.9) :  How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?

    Ans => (Cell Padding):
                          Cell padding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content present in it.
                          Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells.

            Ex.
                          with padding                         with Spacing
                                      
          (Cell Spacing):
                         Cell spacing is the space between each cell.
                         By default, the space is set to 2 pixels.

    (Q.10) :  How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?

    Ans =>   Example HTML table
                     <table border="1" style="width: 100%;">
                            <tr>
                                   <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                                   <td>&nbsp;</td>
                            </tr>
                     </table>

              <p> The code above, rendered in a web browser, produces a table similar to the table below.
                  As shown, the first cell spans the width of two columns.</p>

              <p> To use all three cells on the top of the table, increase the colspan value to 3 since there are three columns.
                  Increasing the value to 3 gives you a table similar to the example below.</p>


              <table border="1" style="width: 100%;">
                    <tbody>
                           <tr>
                                  <td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td>
                           </tr>

                           <tr>
                                  <td>&nbsp;</td>
                                  <td>&nbsp;</td>
                                  <td>&nbsp;</td>
                           </tr>

                           <tr>
                            <td>&nbsp;</td>
                            <td>&nbsp;</td>
                            <td>&nbsp;</td>
                           </tr>
                    </tbody>
              </table>

   (Q.11): What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

   Ans =>  <h1>Block-level Elements</h1>

         <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically
            add some space (a margin) before and after the element.</p>

        <p>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>    

        Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

        The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
              
        The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

         Ex : 
              <h2>Block-level Element</h2>      
               _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
              | The <p> element is a block-level element.                                                                                       |
              |_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|

               _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
              | The <div> element is a block-level element.                                                                                     |
              |_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________|


              # Here are the block-level elements in HTML: 

                     <address>Address tag</address>                <dl></dl>                   <form></form>               <p></p>

                     <article>article tag</article>                <dt></dt>                   <header></header>           <pr></pr>

              # Inline Elements :
              
              An inline element does not start on a new line.

              An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

              This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

                     <a href="#"></a>                     <code></code>        <object></object>      <sub></sub>

                      Ex:
                      _______________________________________________
                     | The <a> element is a inline-level element.</a>|
                     |_______________________________________________|       

    (Q.12) : How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?

    Ans =>  The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
            
            Ex:
               <a href="Hyperlink" > name of the link </a>

    (Q.13) : What is the use of an iframe tag?

    Ans => The iframe tag specifies an inline frame.
            An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

            Ex:
                <!-- <iframe src="https://uiuxsource.com/" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe> -->

    (Q.14) : What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?
    
    Ans => The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
           The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. 
           The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

              Ex:
                     <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>

     (Q.15) : How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?

     Ans =>  The most common & simple way to add a background image is by using the background image attribute inside the <body> tag.
             The background attribute which we specified in the <body> tag is not supported in HTML5. Using CSS properties, 
             we can also add background images to a webpage.

             Ex:
             <style>
              body {
                background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
              }
              </style>

     (Q.16) : How are active links different from normal links?
     
     Ans =>   An unvisited link is underlined and blue ,
              A visited link is underlined and purple ,
              An active link is underlined and red .

    (Q.17) : What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

    Ans => We separate a section of text in HTML using the below tags:

              Ex:

                <br> tag - It is used to separate the line of text.<br>
                     It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.

                <p> tag - This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.

                <blockquote> tag - This tag is used to define large quoted sections.


    (Q.18) : What is SVG?

    Ans => An SVG image begins with an <svg> element
           
           The width and height attributes of the <svg> element define the width and height of the SVG image
           The <circle> element is used to draw a circle
           The cx and cy attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle. If cx and cy are not set, the circle's center is set to (0, 0)
           The r attribute defines the radius of the circle
           The stroke and stroke-width attributes control how the outline of a shape appears. We set the outline of the circle to a 4px green "border"
           The fill attribute refers to the color inside the circle. We set the fill color to yellow
           The closing </svg> tag closes the SVG image
    
    
       Ex:
           <svg width="100" height="100">
              <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
           </svg>

    (Q.19) :  What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

    Ans =>  HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. 
            Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of features, such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.

            Ex:
              
                     
    (Q.20) :  What are logical and physical tags in HTML?

    Ans => Logical tag :
                         An example of a logical tag is <strong> </strong> tag. When we enclose the text in the strong tag, 
                         it tells the browser that the enclosed text is more important than other text. 
                         
           physical tag :
                         Physical tags are used to tell the browser how to display the text enclosed in the physical tag.              

                         Examples of Physical Tags:

                         1.<b>: HTML <b> tag </b> acts as a presentation tag used to markup written text as a bold format. 
                                If we want to display plain text in bold format you can use text between <b>sentence</b> tag.
